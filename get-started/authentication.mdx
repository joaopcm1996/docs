The Adaptive API uses API keys for authentication. All API requests should include your API key in an `Authorization` HTTP Header as such:
```
Authorization: Bearer ADAPTIVE_API_KEY
```
The Adaptive Python SDK allows you configure your API key on instantiation of the Adaptive client, as such:

```Python Python
from adaptive_sdk import Adaptive

client = Adaptive(base_url="ADAPTIVE_URL", api_key="ADAPTIVE_API_KEY")
```

You can also set an environment variable `$ADAPTIVE_API_KEY` instead of explicitly passing it to the Adaptive client.

If you are using the OpenAI Python library to [make inference requests](/get-started/inference), you can configure the OpenAI Client as such:

```Python Python
from openai import Client

oai_client = Client(
       base_url="ADAPTIVE_URL/api/v1",
    	api_key="ADAPTIVE_API_KEY",
)
```
